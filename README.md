# BipAndGoSupport
A Support for the v3 bip&amp;go highway badge

there's a project prior to mine out there that made this badge holder https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3676352 unfortunately, is stl doesn't work with my slicer (icesl) and the source is in a format where i have no software to edit it.....

so i redesigned it in openscad!
